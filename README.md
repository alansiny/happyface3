### Project Description
HappyFace is a fun and interactive app designed to brighten your day, boost your mood, and help you cultivate positive habits. With engaging features like personalized mood tracking, uplifting prompts, and thoughtful reflection exercises, HappyFace makes it easy to focus on your mental well-being.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Before HappyFace, people often struggled to monitor their fatigue levels and predict how their mood might change throughout the day. They had no easy way to understand the connection between tiredness and emotional state, making it difficult to manage energy, productivity, and overall well-being. HappyFace addresses this by tracking users‚Äô tiredness, analyzing patterns, and predicting their next mood. By providing personalized insights and recommendations, the app helps users plan their day better, maintain emotional balance, and take proactive steps to improve mental and physical wellness.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
HappyFace helps users understand and manage their mood by tracking their tiredness and predicting how it might affect their emotional state. The app collects data on energy levels, daily routines, and emotional patterns to provide personalized insights. Based on this, it predicts the user‚Äôs next mood and offers suggestions to improve well-being‚Äîsuch as taking a break, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in uplifting activities. By combining mood tracking, fatigue monitoring, and predictive insights, HappyFace empowers users to make informed decisions about their day, maintain emotional balance, and cultivate a healthier, more positive lifestyle.

*The video demonstrates the complete flow of the Happy Face project, starting from the app‚Äôs home interface and guiding the viewer through its main features. It begins with the mood assessment section, where the user answers simple questions such as rating their current mood, recalling something that made them smile, and sharing personal reflections. These inputs are then processed by the app‚Äôs analysis engine, which evaluates the user‚Äôs emotional state. The results are displayed in the ‚ÄúMood Analysis‚Äù screen, showing metrics like tiredness percentage, predicted mood, and anger level (with humorous comparisons such as ‚ÄúSimilar to Gordon Ramsay‚Äù). Finally, the app provides a wellness tip‚Äîintentionally designed to increase tiredness‚Äîhelping the user relax or wind down. Overall, the video showcases how Happy Face combines playful interaction, emotional tracking, and personalized feedback into a lighthearted yet engaging experience.*
